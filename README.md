# PicoSystem Boilerplate

If you're starting a project in your own GitHub repository, this boilerplate will show you how to set it up.

You should have:

- CMakeLists.txt
- main.cpp and main.hpp (and/or your sources)
- pico_sdk_import.cmake - Helper to find the Pico SDK
- picosystem_sdk_import.cmake  - Helper to find the PicoSystem SDK


You should also have the Pico SDK and PicoSystem SDK's in directories alongside this one:

- PicoSystem SDK - https://github.com/pimoroni/picosystem
- Pico SDK - https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/
